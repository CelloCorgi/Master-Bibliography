    abstract = "The aim of this review is to discuss the most recent evidence for the short-term and long-term effects of cannabis on cognition. The evidence that cannabis intoxication is associated with short-term impairment across several basal cognitive domains, including learning and (episodic) memory, attentional control, and motor inhibition is increasing. However, evidence regarding the effects of long-term heavy cannabis use on cognition remains equivocal. Cannabis research suffers from difficulties in measuring cannabis exposure history, poor control over potential subacute effects, and heterogeneity in cognitive measures and sample composition. Multidisciplinary collaborations and investment in studies that help overcome these difficulties should be prioritized.",
