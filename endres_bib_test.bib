	abstract = {That alcohol provides a benefit to creative processes has long been assumed by popular culture, but to date has not been tested. The current experiment tested the effects of moderate alcohol intoxication on a common creative problem solving task, the Remote Associates Test (RAT). Individuals were brought to a blood alcohol content of approximately .075, and, after reaching peak intoxication, completed a battery of RAT items. Intoxicated individuals solved more RAT items, in less time, and were more likely to perceive their solutions as the result of a sudden insight. Results are interpreted from an attentional control perspective.},

@article{Kroon2021TheShort,
	abstract = {The aim of this review is to discuss the most recent evidence for the short-term and long-term effects of cannabis on cognition. The evidence that cannabis intoxication is associated with short-term impairment across several basal cognitive domains, including learning and (episodic) memory, attentional control, and motor inhibition is increasing. However, evidence regarding the effects of long-term heavy cannabis use on cognition remains equivocal. Cannabis research suffers from difficulties in measuring cannabis exposure history, poor control over potential subacute effects, and heterogeneity in cognitive measures and sample composition. Multidisciplinary collaborations and investment in studies that help overcome these difficulties should be prioritized.},
